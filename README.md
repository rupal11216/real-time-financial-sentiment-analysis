# Real-Time Financial News Sentiment Analyser

## Overview
This project involved building a real-time financial news sentiment analysis system to study how market news and headlines reflect investor sentiment. The system analyzes financial news articles and classifies them based on sentiment to support market awareness and decision-making.

The project focuses on the intersection of finance, data analysis, and technology by combining natural language processing techniques with real-time news data.

## Objective
To design and implement a system that captures live financial news, processes textual data, and evaluates sentiment trends that may influence market perception.

## Problem Context
Financial markets are highly sensitive to news and information flow. Investors and analysts often rely on headlines and reports to understand market direction, but manually processing large volumes of news is inefficient. This project addresses the need for automated sentiment analysis to extract meaningful signals from financial news content.

## Approach
- Collected real-time financial news data from online sources
- Preprocessed textual data using standard NLP techniques
- Applied sentiment analysis methods to classify news as positive, negative, or neutral
- Analyzed sentiment trends to understand overall market mood
- Visualized sentiment outputs for easier interpretation

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Sentiment analysis techniques
- Data analysis and visualization libraries

## Key Features
- Real-time processing of financial news headlines
- Automated sentiment classification of news articles
- Aggregated sentiment insights for market-level interpretation
- Clear separation between data collection, analysis, and visualization components

## Key Learnings
- Practical application of NLP techniques on financial text
- Understanding how news sentiment impacts market perception
- Handling unstructured textual data efficiently
- Translating qualitative information into quantitative indicators

## Use Case
This project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be applied in financial markets to assist analysts, traders, or researchers in monitoring news-driven market sentiment and supporting informed decision-making.
